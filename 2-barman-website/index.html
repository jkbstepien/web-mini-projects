        <p class="origins-text">Havana, Cuba, is the birthplace of the mojito, although its exact origin is the
            subject of debate. It was known that the local South American Indians had remedies for various tropical
            illnesses, so a small boarding party went ashore on Cuba and came back with ingredients for an
            effective medicine. </p>
        <p class="origins-text">The ingredients were aguardiente de caña (translated as "burning water", a crude
            form of rum made from sugar cane) mixed with local tropical ingredients: lime, sugarcane juice, and mint.
            Lime juice on its own
            would have significantly prevented scurvy and dysentery, and tafia/rum was soon added as it became
            widely available to the British (ca. 1650). Mint, lime and sugar were also helpful in hiding the harsh
            taste of this spirit.</p>
